## Setup

Before using `snob`, you should get an OMDb API key by following [these steps](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).

After that, you can set your key like this:

  ```bash
  snob -k <your-api-key>
  ```

Once you have set your key, you can make a simple search:

  ```bash
  snob lost ark
  ```

Use `snob -h` to see all the available commands.
